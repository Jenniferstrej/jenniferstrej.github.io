Last month I coached a class of Python for beginners for Women Who Code. The people varied from complete beginners, to people who have had a go with other languages.

Some of the things I noticed was that you cannot assume people will run commands on the command line so naturally, and of course, I didn't always know that either! So I prepared some material inspired on various sources and included a little command line overview.
