<p>This is a presentation that I prepared about my findings on unit testing with Python.
It was an introduction to mostly non Python developers but everyone was technical.
I can say that is one of the first technical presentations Iâ€™ve given since Uni and it has helped me gain more confidence to do it again :).</p>
