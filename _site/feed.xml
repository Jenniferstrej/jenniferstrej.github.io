      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/03/02/python-for-beginners/">&lt;p&gt;Last month I coached a class of Python for beginners for Women Who Code. The people varied from complete beginners, to people who have had a go with other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I noticed was that you cannot assume people will run commands on the command line so naturally, and of course, I haven’t always known that either! So I prepared some material inspired by various sources and included a little command line overview.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/02/02/unit-testing-with-python/">&lt;p&gt;This is a presentation that I prepared about my findings on unit testing with Python.
It was an introduction to mostly non Python developers but everyone was technical.
I can say that is one of the first technical presentations I’ve given since Uni and it has helped me gain more confidence to do it again :).&lt;/p&gt;
